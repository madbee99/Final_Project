Individual project - no teammates

Topic: 2019 College Admisssions

The goal of my project is to predict whether or not someone will get into a particular college (chosen from a drop-down menu) based on an individual's inputted test scores and admissions/acceptance rates, etc. for that particluar school.

My dataset is from https://nces.ed.gov and is saved in the resources folder. I've selected only 4-year colleges located in California. I am debating whether or not I just want to use test scores (SAT and ACT) as predictor variables or also use some of the categorical variables (whether or not a secondary GPA is required in one's applciation).  

Here are screenshots of the selections I made for my dataset:
